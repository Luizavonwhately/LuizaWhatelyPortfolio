      <h2>Isa Silva</h2>
      <h4>Visual Identity | Campaign | Product Design</h4>
      <p>
        <br>
        So, how do you translate a brand that’s deeply personal, political, and emotional into a visual and strategic structure that allows it to grow without losing its roots?

We knew we had to revisit the brand’s entire journey without softening its edge. The goal was to reposition Isa Silva not just as a creative mind, but as an institution of contemporary fashion. We created tools to support a visual and verbal identity that’s plural and elevated, and most importantly made the brand more readable and cohesive across audiences: from everyday customers to the luxury segment, from local to global.
     <br> <br>
     The creative concept behind the brand’s new identity was named Memory of the Sun, a symbolic tribute to the vital, illuminating, and revealing force the sun represents. “We see Isa, both as a creator and a brand, as someone who carries this solar legacy the ability to bring things to life, to make visible the colors, the stories, and the bodies that need to be seen.”

The visual identity dives into Bahia’s popular aesthetic and the visual language of inverted contrast to shape an expressive, original logotype. Inspired by the lettering of Oficina de Cabelo Zé do Punk, the logo honors Isa Silva’s roots with a bold and plural voice—where each letter claims its own authenticity, celebrates diversity, and subverts convention with elegance.

The ink brush illustrations were recreated by many hands, evoking the handmade gesture and the ancestral force behind each design. The abbreviation IS, for Isa Silva, revealed a poetic play on meaning: IS, the verb “to be” in English; si, as in “being oneself”; and the shape of a cowrie shell, a spiritual symbol that also echoes the brand’s visual language. A quiet but powerful metaphor that sustains the brand’s symbolic universe.

The black-and-white palette brings timeless sophistication, evoking the heat and clarity of the midday sun, and grounding the brand’s minimalist aesthetic. The visual system was designed to adapt across the brand’s different formats from tailor-made collections to accessible lines, from digital presence to the intimate setting of the atelier.

Tying everything together, the brand manifesto sets the tone with poetic clarity. It positions the brand as a portal—between the singular and the collective, between body and territory, between Bahia and the world.
