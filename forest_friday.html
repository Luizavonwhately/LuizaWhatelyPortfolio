      <h2>Forest Friday</h2>
      <h4>Publication</h4>
      <p>
        Forest Friday is a concept rooted in the idea of intentional pause, a weekly reminder to reconnect with nature, slow down, and reset. The project explores how being present and in nature can evoke calm, clarity, and a sense of place. The goal of the project is to encouraging people to make space for quiet moments and natural connection in their everyday lives. <br><br> The outcome was a self-publication of cards in which one of them represent a moment lived during the volunteer Friday. A visit from a wild animal, the removal of non-native plant - memories created that only by going outside you are able to find it. In addition, a poster was developed to explain each of the cards. the goal - inspire others to keep collecting cards/memories outside.
