      <h1>Educom</h2>
      <h4> Visual Identity | Event Design</h3>
      <p>
        The undergraduate program in Educommunication, offered by the School of Communication and Arts at the University of São Paulo (USP) and better known as Educom, prepares professionals to manage communication processes in both formal and informal educational settings. Since it’s one of the newest programs at ECA, it doesn’t yet have the same visibility as others — which makes it essential to build an engaging brand that conveys the transformative power of this discipline.
        <br><br>
        The chosen path was typographic: starting from the Elza typeface, we created a system where letters generate graphic elements and appear in two versions — institutional and organic. This approach allows the logo to adapt into countless variations, fitting different contexts and reflecting both the broad scope of the course and the many possibilities it opens up.
        <br><br>
        For the color palette, we defined vibrant and joyful tones that, when combined, create strong contrast, enhancing legibility and accessibility — one of the key points highlighted by the client.
        <br><br>
        Beyond the course itself, the system was also adopted by Educom Week, an annual event organized by students to foster dialogue with the market and society through talks, workshops, and debates related to the field.
